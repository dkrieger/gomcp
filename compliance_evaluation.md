# MCP Server Implementation Compliance Checklist (gomcp)

This document provides a checklist evaluating the `gomcp/server` implementation against the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) documentation and the `2025-03-26/schema.json` schema. Adherence to both the documentation and the formal schema is crucial for full compliance.

## Overview

The `gomcp/server` package provides a framework for building MCP servers in Go. It aims to implement the core features of the MCP protocol, allowing Go applications to expose tools, resources, and prompts to MCP clients.

## Compliance Checklist

Based on the review of the official documentation (Quickstart, Tools, Resources, Architecture) and the `2025-03-26/schema.json` schema, the `gomcp/server` implementation demonstrates compliance with the following aspects:

### Core Concepts

- [x] **Server Structure:** The `Server` struct encapsulates the main server logic and manages components like Registry, TransportManager, and MessageHandler.
- [x] **Capabilities:** The server tracks implemented capabilities using boolean flags, corresponding to `ServerCapabilities` in the schema.
- [x] **Transports:** Supports multiple transports (Stdio, WebSocket, SSE) managed by `TransportManager`.
- [x] **Messaging:** The `MessageHandler` handles core JSON-RPC message types (Request, Response, Notification) and dispatching.

### Specific MCP Features

- [x] **Initialization:** Correctly handles the `initialize` request for session establishment and capability exchange.
- [x] **Tools:**
  - [x] Registry allows registration of tools with definitions and handlers.
  - [x] `Tool` method validates handler signatures and generates `InputSchema`.
  - [x] `MessageHandler` handles `tools/call` requests and executes handlers.
  - [x] Tool execution errors are intended to be reported within the `CallToolResult`.
- [x] **Resources:**
  - [x] Registry supports registration of static resources and resource templates.
  - [x] `AddResourceTemplate` uses `uritemplate` and reflection for template handling.
  - [x] `MessageHandler` handles `resources/list` requests.
  - [x] `MessageHandler` handles `resources/read` requests for static and templated resources, handling different content types.
  - [x] Includes logic to send `notifications/resources/list_changed` and `notifications/resources/updated`.
- [x] **Prompts:**
  - [x] Registry allows registration of prompts.
  - [x] `MessageHandler` handles `prompts/list` requests.
  - [x] Includes logic to send `notifications/prompts/list_changed`.
- [x] **Logging:** Includes basic logging capabilities and handles `logging/setLevel`.
- [x] **Completions:** `MessageHandler` includes a handler for `completion/complete`.
- [x] **Sampling:** `Server` struct has `ImplementsSampling` flag and `MessageHandler` includes related logic for `sampling/createMessage`.

## Areas for Further Review/Verification / Implementation

The following areas require more in-depth review, verification, or implementation to ensure full compliance with the MCP documentation and schema:

- [ ] **Schema Validation:** Requires implementing strict JSON schema validation for all incoming and outgoing messages against `2025-03-26/schema.json`.
- [x] **Complete Capability Implementation:** Reviewed capability flags in `Server` struct. Note that `ImplementsResourceListChanged` and `ImplementsAuthorization` are marked as not fully implemented or TODOs in the code.
- [x] **Error Handling:** Reviewed error handling in `MessageHandler` and `stdio_transport.go`. Covers parsing errors, invalid requests/params, method not found, and distinguishes between protocol/tool/resource errors. Potential refinement areas include explicit cancellation error responses and transport-level parse errors.
- [ ] **Transport Robustness:** Requires thorough testing of all transport implementations under various conditions (e.g., malformed messages, disconnections, high load).
- [x] **Concurrency and Thread Safety:** Reviewed use of mutexes and RWMutexes in `MessageHandler`, `Registry`, and `SubscriptionManager`. Synchronization appears correctly implemented for protecting shared state.
- [x] **Resource Template Matching:** Reviewed `matchURITemplate` and `prepareHandlerArgs` logic; handles basic cases and relies on parameter order.
- [x] **Context Implementation:** Examined `server/context.go` for implementation details and how it facilitates client requests and progress reporting.

## Test Results

The tests for the following packages and subdirectories are passing:

- `./server`
- `./protocol`
- `./transport/sse`
- `./transport/stdio`
- `./transport/websocket`
- `./transport/tcp`

Note that running `go test ./transport` failed as expected because there are no Go files directly in that directory; the transport tests are located in the subdirectories listed above.

## Conclusion

The `gomcp/server` implementation provides a solid foundation for building MCP servers in Go and demonstrates a strong understanding of the core MCP concepts and protocol structure. The checklist above summarizes the current evaluation status and identifies areas that require further implementation or testing to achieve full compliance with the MCP documentation and schema. The existing tests for the core server components, protocol, and individual transport implementations are passing.
