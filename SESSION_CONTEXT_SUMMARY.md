# GoMCP Library Development - Session Context Summary (2025-03-29)

## Initial Goal

The primary objective was to build a Go library (`gomcp`) implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for both client and server interactions, based on the official specification available at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## Key Development Stages & Features Implemented

1.  **Initial Structure:** Basic `protocol.go`, `transport.go`, `client.go`, `server.go` files were created.
2.  **JSON-RPC Alignment:** Refactored the transport layer and message handling away from a custom `Message` struct to strictly adhere to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification using `JSONRPCRequest`, `JSONRPCResponse`, and `JSONRPCNotification` structures. Implemented request/response matching using IDs.
3.  **Client/Server Abstractions:** Introduced `mcp.Client` and `mcp.Server` structs to encapsulate connection handling, initialization, and method dispatch, providing a higher-level API over the raw connection.
4.  **Specification Compliance (v2025-03-26):** Implemented core MCP methods and notifications according to the [2025-03-26 spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/):
    - **Initialization:** Full handshake (`initialize`, `initialized`) with capability exchange.
    - **Tooling:** `tools/list`, `tools/call`.
    - **Resources:** `resources/list`, `resources/read`, `resources/subscribe`, `resources/unsubscribe`.
    - **Prompts:** `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`.
    - **Logging:** `logging/set_level`, `notifications/message`.
    - **Sampling:** `sampling/create_message`.
    - **Roots:** `roots/list`.
    - **Ping:** `ping`.
    - **Cancellation:** `$/cancelled` notification handling via `context.Context`.
    - **Progress:** `$/progress` notification sending infrastructure.
    - **Notifications (Server -> Client):** Implemented dynamic triggering for `notifications/tools/list_changed`, `notifications/resources/list_changed`, `notifications/prompts/list_changed`, `notifications/roots/list_changed`, and `notifications/resources/updated` based on server actions (e.g., `RegisterTool`, `NotifyResourceUpdated`) and client subscriptions.
5.  **Schema Field/Name Alignment:** Ensured struct field names (`Data` for image/audio, `Blob` for blob resources) and notification names/params (`ResourceUpdatedParams`, `MethodNotifyResourceUpdated`) match the official JSON schema. Added optional `Annotations` to content types.
6.  **Custom JSON Unmarshalling:** Implemented `UnmarshalJSON` methods for `CallToolResult`, `PromptMessage`, and `SamplingMessage` to correctly handle the polymorphic `[]Content` interface slice during decoding.
7.  **Example Updates:**
    - Refactored all examples in `cmd/` and `examples/` (server, client, auth, billing, rate-limit) to use the new `mcp.Client` and `mcp.Server` APIs.
    - Created a comprehensive `examples/kitchen-sink-server` demonstrating most features.
8.  **Test Refactoring:**
    - Updated `examples/client/main_test.go` and `examples/server/main_test.go` to use piped connections and simulate client/server interactions using the correct JSON-RPC methods on the `mcp.Connection` level, validating the behavior of the `mcp.Client` and `mcp.Server` abstractions.
    - Fixed issues related to timeouts, variable scopes, and test assertions.
9.  **Documentation:** Updated `README.md` to reflect the current status and API usage patterns.

## Final Status

- The core library (`gomcp` package) is considered compliant with the implemented features of the MCP v2025-03-26 specification.
- All examples have been refactored to use the current API.
- Core library tests (`go test .`) and example tests (`go test ./examples/...`) are passing.
- The `README.md` provides updated basic usage examples.

## Potential Next Steps / Minor Tasks

- Update the documentation in the `docs/` directory and the GitHub Pages site.
- Consider removing or further simplifying the basic `cmd/mcp-client` and `cmd/mcp-server` examples, as `examples/kitchen-sink-server` and `examples/client` are more representative.
- Implement remaining spec features if any were missed (e.g., specific error codes, more complex filtering).
- Add more robust error handling and edge case testing.
