# GoMCP - Go Model Context Protocol Library

Welcome to the documentation for `gomcp`, a Go library for implementing the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

This library provides the building blocks for creating MCP servers (tool providers) and clients (tool consumers). While originally focused on standard I/O, it now supports multiple transport mechanisms like SSE.

## Getting Started

- **[Overview](./overview.md):** Learn about the library's architecture and core components.
- **[Installation](./installation.md):** How to add the library to your Go project.
- **[Basic Usage](./basic_usage.md):** Simple examples of implementing a client and server.
- **[Examples](../examples/README.md):** Explore runnable examples demonstrating different tools (echo, calculator, filesystem).
- **[Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/localrivet/gomcp):** Detailed Go package documentation.
