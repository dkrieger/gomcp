// Package gomcp provides the core implementation for the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
// in Go. It defines message structures, transport mechanisms (currently stdio),
// and basic client/server logic for establishing connections via the MCP handshake.
//
// DEPRECATED: This root package is deprecated. Use the subpackages (types, protocol,
// transport, server, client) instead. This file will be removed in a future version.
package gomcp

// TODO: Remove this file once all code has been migrated to subpackages.
