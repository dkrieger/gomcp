# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create Comprehensive Examples
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a set of comprehensive examples demonstrating various use cases of the library.
# Details:
Create comprehensive examples for various use cases:

1. Basic server and client examples
2. Examples for each transport type
3. Tool, resource, and prompt registration examples
4. Progress reporting and cancellation examples
5. Advanced usage with hooks and customization

Example structure:
```
examples/
  basic/
    server.go - Basic server implementation
    client.go - Basic client implementation
  transports/
    stdio/
      server.go - Stdio server example
      client.go - Stdio client example
    http/
      server.go - HTTP server example
      client.go - HTTP client example
    websocket/
      server.go - WebSocket server example
      client.go - WebSocket client example
    tcp/
      server.go - TCP server example
      client.go - TCP client example
  tools/
    calculator.go - Example calculator tool
    weather.go - Example weather API tool
  resources/
    document.go - Example document resource
  prompts/
    chatbot.go - Example chatbot prompt
  advanced/
    progress.go - Progress reporting example
    cancellation.go - Cancellation example
    hooks.go - Hook system example
```

Each example should include detailed comments explaining the code and usage patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Ensure all examples compile and run correctly. Create automated tests that run the examples and verify their output. Test examples with different Go versions to ensure compatibility. Create documentation that references and explains the examples. Verify examples cover all major features of the library.
