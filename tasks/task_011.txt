# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Tool Registration and Execution
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement tool registration and execution functionality in the server package.
# Details:
Implement tool registration and execution:

```go
// server/tool.go
package server

// ToolHandler represents a tool handler function
type ToolHandler func(ctx *Context, args interface{}) (interface{}, error)

// Tool represents a registered tool
type Tool struct {
	Name        string
	Description string
	Handler     ToolHandler
	Schema      map[string]interface{}
	// Additional fields
}

// registerTool registers a tool with the server
func (s *Server) registerTool(name, description string, handler ToolHandler, schema map[string]interface{}) *Server {
	// Implementation
	return s
}

// executeTool executes a tool
func (s *Server) executeTool(ctx *Context, name string, args map[string]interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
	// Implementation
}
```

Implement struct tag-based parameter validation:

```go
// Extract schema from handler function parameter type
func extractSchema(handler interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error) {
	// Use reflection to analyze the handler's parameter type
	// Extract struct tags and generate schema
}

// Validate and convert arguments to the appropriate type
func validateAndConvertArgs(schema map[string]interface{}, args map[string]interface{}, paramType reflect.Type) (interface{}, error) {
	// Validate args against schema
	// Convert args to the appropriate struct type
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for tool registration with various handler signatures. Test tool execution with valid and invalid arguments. Test struct tag-based validation. Test error handling for missing or invalid tools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Tool struct and registration method [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Complete the implementation of the Tool struct and the registerTool method to allow tools to be registered with the server.
### Details:
Implement the Tool struct with all required fields. Complete the registerTool method to store registered tools in a map within the Server struct. Add a tools map field to the Server struct if it doesn't exist. The method should validate that the tool name is unique and return the server instance for method chaining.

Implement the Tool struct with all required fields. Complete the registerTool method to store registered tools in a map within the Server struct. Add a tools map field to the Server struct if it doesn't exist. The method should validate that the tool name is unique and return the server instance for method chaining.

The implementation has been completed with the following components:
1. The Tool struct has been implemented with all necessary fields to represent a tool in the system.
2. A registerTool method has been added to the serverImpl struct that properly stores tools in a tools map.
3. The existing Tool method in server.go has been updated to utilize the new registerTool method.
4. Validation logic has been implemented to check for:
   - Empty tool names (with appropriate warnings)
   - Duplicate tool names (with appropriate warnings)
5. The implementation maintains the server's fluent API design by returning the server instance for method chaining.
6. Comprehensive tests have been written to verify:
   - Successful tool registration
   - Proper handling of duplicate tools
   - Validation of tool names
   - Type conversion correctness
7. All tests are now passing, confirming the implementation works as expected.

## 2. Implement schema extraction using reflection [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement the extractSchema function that uses reflection to analyze a handler's parameter type and generate a schema based on struct tags.
### Details:
Use the reflect package to examine the handler function's parameter type. For struct types, iterate through fields and extract tags like `json:"field_name"` and `description:"field description"`. Generate a JSON Schema compatible map that describes the expected input parameters. Handle nested structs, basic types (string, int, bool, etc.), and slices/arrays.

Use the reflect package to examine the handler function's parameter type. For struct types, iterate through fields and extract tags like `json:\"field_name\"` and `description:\"field description\"`. Generate a JSON Schema compatible map that describes the expected input parameters. Handle nested structs, basic types (string, int, bool, etc.), and slices/arrays.

The implementation has been completed with a comprehensive approach to schema extraction:

1. Created a robust schema generation system using Go's reflection capabilities
2. Implemented `generateSchemaFromStruct` function that analyzes struct types and produces corresponding JSON Schema
3. Developed `generatePropertySchema` function to handle individual field schema generation with proper type mapping
4. Added support for complex types including:
   - Nested structs with proper property nesting
   - Arrays/slices with appropriate item type definitions
   - Maps with key/value type information
5. Enhanced schema metadata using struct tags for:
   - Field descriptions via `description` tags
   - Enumeration values via `enum` tags
   - Validation constraints (min/max values, patterns, formats)
6. Created `getJSONType` utility to accurately map Go types to JSON Schema types
7. Ensured proper handling of all struct tags including special cases
8. Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
9. Fixed type conversion issues in nested schema generation

The implementation now provides comprehensive schema extraction for all supported Go types while preserving compatibility with the existing codebase.

## 3. Implement argument validation and conversion [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement the validateAndConvertArgs function to validate incoming arguments against the schema and convert them to the appropriate type.
### Details:
Compare incoming arguments against the schema to ensure all required fields are present and of the correct type. Convert the validated map of arguments into an instance of the parameter type expected by the handler function. Use reflection to set field values. Handle type conversions (e.g., string to int) and return appropriate errors for validation failures.

Convert the validated map of arguments into an instance of the parameter type expected by the handler function. Use reflection to set field values. Handle type conversions (e.g., string to int) and return appropriate errors for validation failures.

After analysis, we identified significant code duplication between server/tool.go and the util/schema package. Instead of implementing a custom validateAndConvertArgs function within the server package, we refactored to use the schema.ValidateAndConvertArgs function directly from the utils/schema package.

The refactoring included:
1. Removing the redundant validateAndConvertArgs function from server/tool.go
2. Updating executeTool to use schema.ValidateAndConvertArgs for validation and conversion
3. Removing other helper functions like isPrimitiveType and convertValue
4. Updating setFieldValue to use schema.NewConverter().Convert
5. Fixing tests to use the util/schema package functionality with proper imports

This refactoring eliminates code duplication and adheres to the DRY principle, making the codebase more maintainable and consistent. All tests are now passing with the new implementation.

## 4. Implement tool execution functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.3
### Description: Complete the executeTool method to find a registered tool by name and execute its handler with the provided arguments.
### Details:
Look up the requested tool by name in the server's tools map. If found, validate and convert the provided arguments using validateAndConvertArgs. Call the tool's handler function with the context and converted arguments. Return the result or error from the handler. If the tool is not found, return an appropriate error.

Call the tool's handler function with the context and converted arguments. Return the result or error from the handler. If the tool is not found, return an appropriate error.

The implementation has been completed in server/tool.go with the following components:

1. The `executeTool` method:
   - Uses read locks for thread-safe access to the tools map
   - Performs tool lookup by name
   - Returns appropriate error if tool not found
   - Uses reflection to get handler's parameter type
   - Leverages schema.ValidateAndConvertArgs for argument validation
   - Executes the tool handler with context and converted arguments
   - Returns results or properly wrapped errors

2. The `ProcessToolCall` method:
   - Validates request format
   - Calls executeTool with tool name and arguments
   - Sets response type and data
   - Handles error conditions

The implementation follows best practices with thread-safe access, proper error handling, separation of concerns, and appropriate use of the schema package. All tests are passing, confirming the functionality works correctly.

## 5. Integrate tool registration with server initialization [done]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Update the server initialization code to support registering tools during setup and expose a public API for tool registration.
### Details:
Add a public RegisterTool method to the Server that wraps the internal registerTool method. Update the server's New or Init function to optionally accept pre-defined tools. Ensure the Context type has necessary methods to support tool execution. Add helper methods for common tool registration patterns if needed.
<info added on 2025-05-15T20:07:31.712Z>
After reviewing the codebase, we should leverage the existing fluent API pattern rather than introducing a new WithTools option. The Server interface already has a Tool() method that provides the correct way to register tools in this codebase.

For proper integration with server initialization:
1. Ensure the Context type has all necessary methods to support tool execution, including access to registered tools and execution capabilities
2. Maintain the existing fluent interface pattern for tool registration (Server.Tool() method)
3. Add helper methods for common tool registration patterns if needed, while preserving the fluent interface design
4. Document the recommended approach for registering tools during server setup, with examples showing how to chain Tool() calls during initialization
5. Verify that tools registered during initialization are properly accessible during request handling

This approach maintains consistency with the existing codebase patterns and provides a clean API for tool registration during server setup.

We successfully completed the integration of tool registration with server initialization by making several key improvements:

1. Exported the HandleMessage method from serverImpl by adding it to the Server interface, making it accessible to clients
2. Updated tests across all MCP specification versions (draft, 2024-11-05, 2025-03-26) to use the exported HandleMessage method directly instead of relying on type assertions
3. Fixed response parsing issues in the integration test that were preventing proper tool execution verification
4. Added comprehensive documentation for the HandleMessage method and server configuration options
5. Set stdio as the default transport constructor in NewServer to provide a better out-of-box experience and eliminate warnings
6. Added a WithTransport option to allow for custom transport configuration when needed
7. Fixed various JSON parsing issues in test code that were causing intermittent failures

All tests now pass successfully, and the tool registration system is fully integrated with server initialization. The implementation maintains the fluent API pattern while providing a clean, well-documented interface for registering and executing tools.
