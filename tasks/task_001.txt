# Task ID: 1
# Title: Define Package Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the initial project structure with all required packages and directories as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create the following directory structure:
- github.com/localrivet/gomcp/
  - gomcp.go (main entry point)
  - mcp/ (core types and specification implementation)
    - v20241105/ (2024-11-05 specification implementation)
    - v20250326/ (2025-03-26 specification implementation)
    - draft/ (latest draft specification implementation)
  - server/ (server implementation)
  - client/ (client implementation)
  - transport/ (transport layer implementations)
    - stdio/ (Standard I/O transport)
    - ws/ (WebSocket transport)
    - sse/ (Server-Sent Events transport)
    - http/ (HTTP transport)
  - util/ (utility packages)
    - slog/ (structured logging utilities)
    - schema/ (schema generation and validation)
    - validator/ (argument validation utilities)
    - conversion/ (type conversion utilities)

Ensure all directories have appropriate README.md files explaining their purpose.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all directories and files are created with the correct structure. Create a simple test that imports the main package to ensure it compiles correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository with go.mod [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository and initialize the Go module with go.mod file and a basic README.md
### Details:
Create a new repository, run 'go mod init github.com/username/project-name', create a README.md with project overview, goals, and basic usage instructions. Include license information and contribution guidelines.

## 2. Create Directory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the directory structure according to the PRD specifications
### Details:
Create directories for cmd/, pkg/, internal/, docs/, examples/, and tests/ following Go project best practices. Ensure the structure aligns with the PRD requirements and facilitates clean separation of concerns.

Create directories for cmd/, pkg/, internal/, docs/, examples/, and tests/ following Go project best practices. Ensure the structure aligns with the PRD requirements and facilitates clean separation of concerns.

Verify that the existing directory structure includes the main directories specified in the PRD: mcp/, server/, client/, transport/, and util/ with their appropriate subdirectories. Check for any missing components and ensure all required directories are properly organized. The structure should support the clean separation of concerns between the MCP server, client implementations, and transport mechanisms. Confirm that each directory has the appropriate placeholder files or initial code structures to maintain Git tracking.

## 3. Setup Package Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create initial documentation files for each package
### Details:
Add package-level documentation with doc.go files in each directory. Include purpose, usage examples, and API descriptions. Follow godoc conventions to ensure documentation is accessible through standard Go tools.

## 4. Create CI Configuration Files [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up continuous integration configuration files
### Details:
Create GitHub Actions or similar CI workflow files. Include configurations for running tests, linting, and building the project. Set up automated testing for multiple Go versions and operating systems.

## 5. Add Development Tools Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Configure development tools like linters, formatters, and editor settings
### Details:
Add .gitignore file with appropriate entries for Go projects. Configure golangci-lint with .golangci.yml. Add .editorconfig for consistent formatting. Include Makefile or similar build scripts for common development tasks.
